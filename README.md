EECS 459 Final Project: Performed Rich-Club Analysis on Exocytosis and Endocytosis PPI Networks

Utilized two different measures of measuring and finding rich-clubs

This is a slightly strange set-up for the Git repository because all of the validation runs were done on Case's HPC cluster.
So the folder Server is directly from what was uploaded to the cluster in order to be able to run these validation runs in a reasonable amount of time.

Everything else was on a laptop.
